This project uses main.py file to connect to LifeDB.db database and utilized mylib functions to update, read, create a table in the db, query and drop the table. The repo consists of: 

* Devcontainer with DockerFile
* workflows with github actions
* gitingnore file
* this Readme.md file
* requirements.txt file
* **main.py file  that can be used in the terminal as a command-line tool.**

  Outline of the project:
  In  mylib:
  1) extract.py - extract dataset by a URL and extract it into a github folder
  2) transform_load.py - transforms the dataset and loads it into the dataset
  3) query.py - connects to the database and allows to perform queries on the database.
  4) crud.py - contains functions to perform crud operations on the database.
